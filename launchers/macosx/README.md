# The Mac OS X Launcher

**Note** this project is WIP, cause Meeh has yet to merge in Obj-C/Swift code for GUI stuff in OSX.

However, this is a thin wrapper launching both Mac OS X trayicon and the I2P router - and make them talk together.

More code will be merged in, it's just a f* mess which Meeh needs to clean up and move into repo.
